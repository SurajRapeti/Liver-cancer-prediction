# Liver Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning  

## Overview  
This project is a **Flask-based web application** that predicts liver disease using **Machine Learning**. It takes user input through a web interface and processes it using a trained **ML model** to classify whether a person is at risk for liver disease.  

## Features  
✅ Web-based interface using **Flask**  
✅ Machine learning model trained on **liver disease dataset**  
✅ Displays prediction results on a separate webpage  

## Tech Stack  
- **Flask** (Backend)  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Processing)  
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning)  
- **HTML/CSS** (Frontend)  
- **Pickle** (Model Serialization)  

## Dataset  
The dataset used for training is stored in **liver.csv**, containing patient details such as **age, gender, bilirubin levels, and protein counts**.
